                            <p>I'm a computer science and software development student currently on my final year at Deakin University. I expect to finish my studies by the end of 2017. Throughout my University years, I have gained some experince developing in C# and ASP.net through assignments and projects. In addition, I have also gained knowledge in computer networks, Linux platform, cryptography, and distributed systems through the units that I have taken. I also have a keen interest on the following, building and flying remoted controlled drones, Radio frquency surfing out of curiosity of the sort of data being transmitted through radio, and wireless network penetration testing hoping to contrubute in making safer networks in the future. </p>    
         
							<p>
								Although I'm not studying game development, my latest project involved developing a virtual reality(VR) tutorial for the HTC vive controllers. 
								My role in this project, along with two other programmers, is to write scripts in C# that will turn the designs, 3D models, and concepts of the project to an executabel minimum viable product. This not only required me to brush-up on my C# skills, but also to learn developing in the Unity game engine on a timely manner. More importantly, working on the project gave me a hands on experience of how it's like working on a development team consisted of team members with different areas of expertise and how we can combine our skills and  work together to deliver what was required of our client.
								Working on this project sparked my interest in game development.

                                    <p>The main purpose of this project is to create a tutorial that will articulate the full potential of virtual reality, provide guidelines around the use of the HTC Vive controllers, and demonstrate the emotional intensity of VR</p>
                                    <p>The tutorial is developed using the unity game engine and C# for scripting. The tutorial consisted of a scene where a robotic AI teaches the user how to use the controllers by instructing the them through audio and text of which button to press and explaining the fuctionalities of each button. The AI will also provide the user different items, each with different interaction characteristic to demostrate what the user can do within the VR world. Verticality of the scene and the way the tutorial ends is also expected to bring some emotions out form the user.</p>
									<p>As a programmer my main task in this project, along with three other programmer, is to develop scripts that will turn the designs and concepts, and models into a reality within the vertual space. These includes but are not limited to, making game objects interactabel, sound scripting, creating certain conditions that will trigger certain events, making the AI speak to the user accompanied by captions to esure users fully understand, etc. <p/>

Few bugs were identified during user testing and the programmers did their best to minimize if not eliminate these bugs to ensure a good quality product for the showcase.</p>
									<p>The bugs that i was able to fix included: Returning objects to the sphere if they fall over the platform, avoid dual teleportation, limit user from teleporting outside of the platform, and identifying and fixing few bugs during the last minutes before the showcase.<p/>

							<h2 class="heading">Snobal Project Summary</h2>
							<p>This capstone project has been very instrumental for me as a student and a future professional as it gave me a hands-on experience on how it’s like working on an actual project with a client, requirements, deadlines, and a team consisted of members with different skills sets and responsibilities. The project indeed demonstrated the importance of skills, teamwork, communication, and self-management. <p/>
							<p>My contribution as a programmer was instrumental in the delivery of this project. Enabling the AI to give the user a tutorial on how to use the controllers is the core functionality of this project as per client requirements. Audible and text instruction made it easier for user to learn how to use the controller while interactive sound effects made the tutorial immersive. The objects floating inside the transparent sphere made the tutorial interesting to the users making them do more interactions thus getting proficient with the controllers. Debbuging ensured that the tutorial face minimal problems during showcase and client demos. Creating agendas prior to meetings made the supervisor meetings short and productive and minutes uploaded on repository helped the team whenever we need to look back on the meetings and review what was agreed upon. <p/>
                             <p>During the span of this unit (SIT302), two sprint retrospective meetings have been conducted with the supervisors. During these meetings, the supervisors discussed their evaluation of the team through feed backs and comments. Based on those two meetings, supervisors were satisfied of the groups performance and the outcome of  the final product.</p>
